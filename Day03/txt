Learning GIT (Version Control System) [Day 3] ðŸš€

Let's learn about the Ignoring Files concept, Branch and Merge ConceptðŸ‘‡

âœ… BRANCH & MERGE

Isolating work in branches, changing context, and integrating changes

âž¡ git branch -> list your branches. a * will appear next to the currently active branch
âž¡ git branch [branch-name] -> create a new branch at the current commit
âž¡ git checkout -> switch to another branch and check it out in your working directory
âž¡ git merge [branch] -> merge the specified branchâ€™s history into the current one
âž¡ git log -> shows all commits in the current branchâ€™s history


âœ… Ignoring Files

âž¡ $ cat .gitignore
/logs/*
!logs/.gitkeep
/tmp
*.swp

Verify the .gitignore file exists in your project and ignore certain types of files, such as all files in the logs directory (excluding the .gitkeep file),
 the whole tmp directory and all files *.swp. File ignoring will work for the directory (and children's directories) where the .gitignore file is placed.
