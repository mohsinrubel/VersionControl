Learning GIT (Version Control System) [Day 5] ðŸš€

Let's learn about the Tagging Known concept, Reverting Changes, and Branch Merging Conflicts ðŸ‘‡

âœ… Tagging known commits

â—½ $ git tag --> List all tags.

â—½ $ git tag [name] [commit sha] --> Create a tag reference named name for the current commit. Add commit sha to tag a specific commit instead of the current one.

â—½ $ git tag -a [name] [commit sha] --> Create a tag object named name for the current commit.

â—½ $ git tag -d [name] --> Remove a tag from the local repository.

âœ… Reverting changes

â—½ $ git reset [--hard] [target reference] -->
Switches the current branch to the target reference, leaving a difference as an uncommitted change. When --hard is used, all changes are discarded.

â—½ $ git reset [file] --> Revert your repository to a previously known working state

â—½ $ git revert [commit sha] -->
Create a new commit, reverting changes from the specified commit. It generates an inversion of changes

âœ… Branch Merging Conflicts

â—½ Modifying files data means arranging data and doing commit as resolve commit and push to a central repository.
